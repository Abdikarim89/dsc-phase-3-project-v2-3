# Customer Churn Analysis
This repository contains analysis for predicting customer churn in a telco business. Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service within a specific time frame. The goal of this project is to identify key factors contributing to churn and develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn.

## Background
Customer churn, the loss of customers, is a significant challenge for businesses as it affects revenue and profitability. This analysis aims to delve into customer churn in the telco industry, identify key factors contributing to churn, and develop actionable strategies to mitigate it.

##  Data Source
The project utilizes data obtained from Kaggle (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset), the analysis is based on a telco dataset that includes various customer attributes such as call duration, charges, customer service calls, and more. The dataset allows us to explore patterns and trends related to customer churn.

## Project Structure
- Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- Scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- Results: Output files, such as model performance metrics and feature importance.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted data exploration to gain insights into the dataset and understand the characteristics of churned customers.

- Preprocessing: Performed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

- Feature Selection: Identified important features using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance from the random forest model.

- Model Building: Employed a random forest classifier to predict customer churn. The model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using various performance metrics.

- Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the churn prediction model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluated the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance.

## Business Understanding
The loss of customers is a pressing issue for businesses, impacting their revenue and profitability. Acquiring new customers comes with high costs, making customer retention essential for sustained success. Identifying and understanding the reasons behind customer attrition is crucial for businesses to develop effective strategies and mitigate this problem.
- Impact on Business:
The high rate of customer churn can lead to a decrease in revenues, subsequently affecting profits. Moreover, acquiring new customers involves substantial expenses in marketing and sales, while the departure of customers can negatively impact a company's reputation.
- Need for a Solution:
To maintain competitiveness, it is crucial for companies to understand the underlying reasons behind customer attrition and take appropriate measures to mitigate it. Implementing an effective solution to address customer churn can enhance customer satisfaction, improve retention rates, and ultimately drive growth and success.


## Results
- The analysis identified customer service calls, total day minutes, and total day charge as the most important factors contributing to customer churn.

- The predictive model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting churn.

- Based on the findings, recommendations were provided to improve customer retention, such as enhancing customer service, offering tailored plans, monitoring usage patterns, and evaluating pricing strategies.


## Recommendations
Based on our key findings, we recommend the following strategies to help reduce customer churn:
- Improve customer service: Enhance customer support by training agents, implementing effective communication channels, and monitoring the customer service process.

- Offer personalized plans: Tailor plans based on individual customer usage patterns, preferences, and budgets to provide value and meet specific needs.

- Monitor usage patterns: Regularly analyze usage patterns like total day charge and total international charge to identify at-risk customers and proactively address their concerns.

- Evaluate pricing strategies: Assess pricing competitiveness, conduct market research, and consider adjustments to prices, discounts, or bundled service offerings.

Implementing these strategies can improve customer retention, reduce churn rates, and attract new customers. By focusing on enhancing customer experience and providing personalized solutions, the telco can foster loyalty and maximize profitability.

## Limitations
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this analysis in order to properly interpret the results. Some of the limitations include:

- Limited data: The dataset used in this analysis may not encompass all the customers or factors that contribute to churn. This limitation could affect the generalizability and representativeness of the findings.
- Complexity of Random Forests: Although Random Forests are a powerful classification technique, they can be complex and time-consuming to train and optimize. This complexity may impact the scalability and practical implementation of the model.
- Imperfect scores: While the analysis achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, it is essential to recognize that no model is perfect. There is still a possibility of incorrect predictions or misclassifications.

## Conclusion
- In conclusion, the analysis of customer churn and its impact on the telco business using a random forest classifier provided valuable insights. The findings highlighted the significance of customer service calls, total day minutes, and total day charge as key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Based on these insights, actionable recommendations were proposed to mitigate customer churn, such as enhancing the customer experience, reducing call wait times, and implementing personalized promotions.
- While the analysis demonstrated high accuracy (0.9268), precision (0.6785), recall (0.8558), and an F1 score of 0.7569, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis, including the limited data and the complexity of random forests.
- Further research and analysis are recommended to validate and enhance the findings, considering additional data sources and exploring alternative modeling approaches. By addressing these limitations, businesses can make more informed decisions to effectively reduce customer churn and improve overall performance.
