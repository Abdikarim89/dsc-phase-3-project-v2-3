# Customer Churn Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for predicting customer churn in a telco business. Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service within a specific time frame. The goal of this project is to identify key factors contributing to churn and develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn.

## Background
Customer churn, the loss of customers, is a significant challenge for businesses as it affects revenue and profitability. This analysis aims to delve into customer churn in the telco industry, identify key factors contributing to churn, and develop actionable strategies to mitigate it.

##  Dataset
The project utilizes data obtained from Kaggle (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset), the analysis is based on a telco dataset that includes various customer attributes such as call duration, charges, customer service calls, and more. The dataset allows us to explore patterns and trends related to customer churn.

## Project Structure
- Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- Scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- Results: Output files, such as model performance metrics and feature importance.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted data exploration to gain insights into the dataset and understand the characteristics of churned customers.

- Preprocessing: Performed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

- Feature Selection: Identified important features using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance from the random forest model.

- Model Building: Employed a random forest classifier to predict customer churn. The model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using various performance metrics.

- Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the churn prediction model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluated the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance.

## Results
- The analysis identified customer service calls, total day minutes, and total day charge as the most important factors contributing to customer churn.

- The predictive model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting churn.

- Based on the findings, recommendations were provided to improve customer retention, such as enhancing customer service, offering tailored plans, monitoring usage patterns, and evaluating pricing strategies.

## Usage
To run the code and reproduce the analysis:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Execute the notebooks or scripts in the specified order to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Conclusion
The analysis of customer churn offers valuable insights to the telecommunications company regarding methods to decrease customer churn. Implementing the suggested strategies has the potential to enhance customer retention, ultimately resulting in improved financial performance for the company. However, additional research and analysis are necessary to enhance the model's accuracy and further fine-tune the recommendations.

## Recommendations
Based on our key findings, we recommend the following strategies to help reduce customer churn:
- Improve customer service: Enhance customer support by training agents, implementing effective communication channels, and monitoring the customer service process.

- Offer personalized plans: Tailor plans based on individual customer usage patterns, preferences, and budgets to provide value and meet specific needs.

- Monitor usage patterns: Regularly analyze usage patterns like total day charge and total international charge to identify at-risk customers and proactively address their concerns.

- Evaluate pricing strategies: Assess pricing competitiveness, conduct market research, and consider adjustments to prices, discounts, or bundled service offerings.

Implementing these strategies can improve customer retention, reduce churn rates, and attract new customers. By focusing on enhancing customer experience and providing personalized solutions, the telco can foster loyalty and maximize profitability.
